## Removing data from dictionary

Since dictionary is mutable, so we can remove items from the dictionary.

There are certain methods available in Python to delete the items or delete entire dictionary.

These are:

### 1. pop(key)

removes the entry with provided key and returns itâ€™s value

### 2. popitem()

same as pop(), the difference being that popitem() removes an arbitary item and returns the (key,value) pair

### 3. del

deletes a single item or the dictionary entirely

### 4. clear()

clears all the items in the dictionary and returns an empty dictionary
